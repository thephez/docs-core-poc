Coinbase
========

The first transaction in a block must be a <> which should collect and
spend any <> paid by transactions included in this block.

Block Subsidy
-------------

Until the coin limit (~18 million Dash) is hit, all blocks are entitled
to receive a block subsidy of newly created Dash value. The newly
created value should be spent in the coinbase transaction.

The block subsidy declines by ~7.1% per year until all Dash is mined.
Subsidy calculations are performed by the Dash Core
`GetBlockSubsidy() <https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.x/src/validation.cpp#L1012>`__
function.

Block Reward
------------

Together, the transaction fees and block subsidy are called the <>. A
coinbase transaction is invalid if it tries to spend more value than is
available from the block reward.

The block reward is divided into three parts: <>, <>, and <>. The miner
and masternode portions add up to 90% of the block subsidy with the
remaining 10% allocated to the governance system.

[/block] ### Block Reward Reallocation

Dash Core v0.16 included logic to gradually adjust the block reward
allocation once the BIP-9 activation threshold was met. The reward
reallocation was signaled via BIP-9 bit 5 and was activated at block
1374912 upon signalling by a sufficient number of blocks.

This reallocation will eventually result in miners receiving 40% of the
non-governance block subsidy and masternodes receiving 60% of it rather
than the 50/50 split that was used for several years.

**Reward reallocation changes**

Reward reallocation changes began at the first superblock following
activation (block 1379128) and then occur every three superblock cycles
(approximately once per quarter) until the reallocation is complete.
