Dash (DIPs)
===========

Similar to Bitcoin’s BIPs, a Dash Improvement Proposal
(`DIP <https://github.com/dashpay/dips>`__) is a design document for
providing information to the Dash community, or describing a new feature
for Dash processes/environment. The DIP should provide a concise
technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.
Please refer to the Dash DIP repository for details on the status of
existing DIPs.

Bitcoin (BIPs)
==============

A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is a design document providing
information to the Bitcoin community, or describing a new feature for
Bitcoin or its processes or environment.

Since Dash is forked from Bitcoin, some BIPs are applicable to both.
Dash-specific BIP information can be found in Dash’s BIP repository.The
repository provides a list of the BIPs that are relevant to Dash. Note
that some BIPs may only be partially implemented or modified to meet
Dash requirements. The ``Dash Status`` column indicates if any changes
were made.
