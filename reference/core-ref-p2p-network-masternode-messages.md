# Masternode Messages

The following network messages enable the <<glossary:masternode>> features built in to Dash.

![Overview Of P2P Protocol Masternode Request And Reply Messages](https://dash-docs.github.io/img/dev/en-p2p-masternode-messages.svg)

For additional details, refer to the Developer Guide [Masternode Sync](core-guide-dash-features-masternode-sync) and [Masternode Payment](core-guide-dash-features-masternode-payment) sections.

## ssc

The [`ssc` message](../ref/core-ref-p2p-network-masternode-messages.md#ssc) is used to track the sync status of masternode objects. This message is sent in response to sync requests for the list of governance objects (`govsync` message), and governance object votes (`govsync` message).

| Bytes | Name | Data type | Required | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| 4 | nItemID | int | Required | Masternode Sync Item ID
| 4 | nCount | int | Required | Number of items to sync

Sync Item IDs

| ID | Description | Response To
|------|--------------|---------------
| 2 | MASTERNODE_SYNC_LIST | _Deprecated following activation of [DIP3](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0003.md) in Dash Core 0.13.0_<br><br>`dseg` message
| 3 | MASTERNODE_SYNC_MNW | _Deprecated following activation of [DIP3](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0003.md) in Dash Core 0.13.0_<br><br>`mnget` message
| 10 | MASTERNODE_SYNC_GOVOBJ | [`govsync` message](../ref/core-ref-p2p-network-governance-messages.md#govsync)
| 11 | MASTERNODE_SYNC_GOVOBJ_VOTE | [`govsync` message](../ref/core-ref-p2p-network-governance-messages.md#govsync) with non-zero hash

The following annotated hexdump shows a [`ssc` message](../ref/core-ref-p2p-network-masternode-messages.md#ssc). (The message header has been omitted.)

## mnauth

*Added in protocol version 70214*

The [`mnauth` message](../ref/core-ref-p2p-network-masternode-messages.md#mnauth) is sent by a <<glossary:masternode>> immediately after sending a [`verack` message](../ref/core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages.md#verack) to authenticate that the sender is a masternode. It is only sent when the sender is actually a masternode.

The [`mnauth` message](../ref/core-ref-p2p-network-masternode-messages.md#mnauth) signs a challenge that was previously sent via a [`version` message](../ref/core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages.md#version). The challenge is signed differently depending on if the connection is inbound or outbound.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "success",
  "body": "As of protocol version 70218, when communicating with masternodes that have reported a version => `MIN_MASTERNODE_PROTO_VERSION`, the mnauth signature is created by signing a message incorporating both the `mnauth_challenge` and protocol `version` (from the [`version` message](../ref/core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages.md#version)). Further details may be found in [Dash Core PR 3631](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/pull/3631).",
  "title": "Protocol Update"
}
[/block]
This is primarily used as a DoS protection mechanism to allow persistent connections between masternodes to remain open even if inbound connection limits are reached.

| Bytes | Name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 32 | proRegTxHash | uint256 | The hash of the ProRegTx that identifies the masternode
| 96 | sig | byte[] | BLS signature of the [`version` message's](../ref/core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages.md#version) `mnauth_challenge`. Signed with the operator key of the masternode.
